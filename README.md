**Problem Statement**: How might Alliance of Angels optimize their website to provide a comprehensive and seamless experience for their users(investors, start-ups, employees), ensuring easy access to events, meetings, research, and collaboration tools?

**Problem Background**: Alliance of Angels, an angel investor community for startups in the Pacific Northwest region, requires integration of data for better management of investors and in order to grow membership.
 Currently, their information data is split between multiple platforms. They use a website for marketing and communication, Zoom for online meetings and recordings, Spark for institutional memory, Groups.io for email facilitation, and Dropbox for file storage. This makes it difficult for them to manage user accounts such as role-based access control and company information. They are also lacking an integrated calendar for all the users which makes it hard for both employees and other parties to be updated.
